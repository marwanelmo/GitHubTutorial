Jane Doe is a 32-year-old woman who went to the doctor because she had sharp pain in her lower left stomach. The pain was an 8 out of 10. The doctor examined her and found that her stomach was tender to the touch in that area and her heart rate and blood pressure were high. The doctor ordered some tests. The results of the tests showed that Jane had an infection or inflammation and a small ovarian cyst. The doctor prescribed antibiotics for the infection and told Jane to come back in a week.
