    The simplification feature is a tool that allows users to take complex or technical text and convert it into simpler, easier-to-understand language. This feature could be especially useful for healthcare organizations, as it could help them to communicate with patients or clients who may not have a medical background or who may have difficulty understanding medical terminology.

    To use the simplification feature, users would enter the text that they want to simplify into a text box. The feature could then use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze the text and identify complex or technical words or phrases. It could then replace those words or phrases with simpler alternatives, or provide definitions or explanations of the terms to help users understand the content more easily.

    The simplification feature could also include options to customize the level of simplification, such as by specifying a target reading level or age group. This could allow users to tailor the level of simplification to the needs of their audience.
